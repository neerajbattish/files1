new correctness challenges security threats for number of reasons. Cong Wang et al [12] describe some of these challenges. Firstly, traditional cryptographic primitives for the purpose of data security protection cannot be directly adopted due to the users’ loss control of data under Cloud Computing. Therefore, verification of correct data storage in the cloud must be conducted without explicit knowledge of the whole data. Considering various kinds of data for each user stored in the cloud and the demand of long term continuous assurance of their data safety, the problem of verifying correctness of data storage in the cloud becomes even more challenging. Secondly, the data stored in the cloud may be frequently updated by the users, including insertion, deletion, modification, appending, reordering, etc. To ensure storage correctness under dynamic data update is hence of paramount importance.

Cloud computing poses many threats related to security .Cong Wang et al [12] explain some of these challenges. Firstly for the data security protection purpose traditional cryptographic primitives cannot be adopted directly as in cloud computing users do lose control of data. So in cloud the correct storage of data must be done without the detailed knowledge of whole data. With the different kind of data in the cloud stored by each users and demand for the safety of their data for long time, so in cloud the problem regarding correctness of data storage has become a new challenge. Secondly users may update i.e. insertion, modification, deletion, reordering, appending, etc their data stored on the cloud on a frequent bases. So under the dynamic update to make sure the correctness of storage is of paramount importance.

The mechanism is based on encryption-based chanllenging access control and over-encryption, it not only ensures secure access to the outsourced data, but also relieve the data owner from user's every access procedure, thus avoid the owner will become the bottleneck during the access and archieve high efficiency.
Q. Liuy et. al.[9] investigate the characteristics of cloud computing and propose an efficient privacy preserving keyword search scheme in cloud computing. The paper allows a service provider to participate in partial decipherment to reduce a client’s computational overhead, and enables the service provider to search the keywords on encrypted files to protect the user data privacy and the user queries privacy efficiently. 

Based on over encryption and encryption-based access control, which not only ensure access of outsoured data securely but also form users every access procedure it releases the data owners. Thus 

Proposes a privacy preserving keyword search scheme in cloud computing. In this paper to reduce the client’s computational overhead the service provider take part in partial decipherment and to protect users query privacy and data privacy the service provider can search keyword in encrypted files.
