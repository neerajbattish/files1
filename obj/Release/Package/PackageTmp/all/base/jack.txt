1.1 Introduction to Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  Cloud Computing includes computational and storage services as per pay as you go model. Cloud services allow individuals and businesses to use software and hardware that are managed by third parties at remote locations. Examples of cloud services include online file storage, social networking sites, webmail, and online business applications. Cloud Computing is very fascinating to business holders as it eradicates the overhead of provisioning and permits the companies to start from small and expand their resources only when there is a great rise in demand of services [1][2]. It serves two types of users: Cloud computing customers and Cloud service providers. 
Cloud computing is not something that suddenly appeared overnight; in some form it may trace back to a time when computer systems remotely time-shared computing resources and applications. More currently though, cloud computing refers to the many different types of services and applications being delivered in the internet cloud, and the fact that, in many cases, the devices used to access these services and applications do not require any special applications. Figure 1.1 represents overview of Cloud Computing.
Many companies are delivering services from the cloud. Some notable examples as of 2010 include the following:
• Google — Has a private cloud that it uses for delivering many different services to its users, including email access, document applications, text translations, maps, web analytics, and much more.
• Microsoft — Has Microsoft SharePoint online service that allows for content and business intelligence tools to be moved into the cloud and Microsoft currently makes its office applications available in a cloud.
• Salesforce.com — runs its application set for its customers in a cloud, and it’s Force.com and Vmforce.com products provide developers with platforms to build customized cloud services.
1.2 Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing have certain essential characteristics which provide qualitative services. These services (Figure 1.2) are as follows [1]:
1.5 Cloud Computing Architecture
Cloud Computing Architecture consists of many cloud components, each of them are loosely   coupled. These components are connected through each other by internet. Figure (1.5) represents the Cloud Computing architecture.
Cloud architecture is divided into two ends Front end and Back end.
•	Front End: Front End refers to the client part of cloud computing system. It consists of interfaces and applications which are required to access the cloud computing platforms, e.g., Web Browser.
•	Back End: Back End refers to the cloud itself. It consists of all the resources required to provide cloud computing services. It comprises of huge data storage, virtual machines, security mechanism, services, deployment models, servers, etc.

1.6 Pros and Cons of Cloud Computing
There are following Pros and Cons of Cloud Computing. (See Figure 1.6)
1.6.1 Pros of Cloud Computing
•	Cost Efficiency: Cloud computing is probably the most cost efficient method to use, maintain and upgrade, as explained in [5]. Traditional desktop software costs companies a lot, in terms of finance. Adding up the licensing fees for multiple users can prove to be very expensive for the establishment concerned. The cloud, on the other hand, is available at much cheaper rates and hence, can significantly lower the company’s IT expenses. Besides, there are many one-time-payments, pay-as-you-go and other scalable options available, which make it very reasonable for the company in question.
•	Almost Unlimited Storage: Storing information in the cloud gives you almost unlimited storage capacity.
•	Backup and Recovery: Since all the data is stored in the cloud, backing it up and restoring the same is relatively much easier than storing the same on a physical device. Furthermore, most cloud service providers are usually competent enough to handle recovery of information. Hence, this makes the entire process of backup and recovery much simpler than other traditional methods of data storage.
•	Automatic Software Integration: In the cloud, software integration is usually something that occurs automatically. This means that Cloud users don’t need to takes additional efforts to customize and integrate their applications as per own preferences. This aspect usually takes care of itself
•	Easy Access to Information: Once the users register in the cloud, they can access the Information from anywhere, where there is an Internet connection. This convenient   feature lets users move beyond time zone and geographic location issues.
•	Quick Deployment: Lastly and most importantly, Cloud computing gives the advantage of quick deployment. Once opting for this method of functioning, the entire system can be fully functional in a matter of a few minutes. Of course, the amount of time taken here will depend on the exact kind of technology that is needed for the business.
•	Easier Scale of Services: It makes it easier for enterprises to scale their service according to the demand of clients.
•	Deliver New Service: It makes possible new classes of applications and deliveries of new services that are interactive in nature.
1.6.2 Cons of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing also has its disadvantages. Businesses, especially smaller ones, need to be aware of these aspects before going in for this technology. The main risks involved in Cloud Computing are:
•	Technical Issues: Though it is true that information and data on the Cloud can be accessed any time and from anywhere, there are moments when the system can have some serious malfunction. Businesses should be aware of the fact that this technology is always prone to outages and other technical issues. Even the best Cloud service providers run into this kind of trouble, in spite of keeping up high standards of maintenance. 
•	Security in the Cloud: Before Recent Advances in Applied Computer Science and Digital Services adopting this technology, beneficiaries should know that they will be surrendering all their company’s sensitive information to a third-party cloud service provider. This could potentially impose a great risk to the company. Hence, businesses need to make sure that they choose the most reliable service provider, who will keep their information totally secure. Switching to the cloud can actually improve security for a small business, as mentioned by Michael Redding, managing director of Accenture Technology Labs. "Because large cloud computing companies have more resources, he says, they are often able to offer levels of security an average small business may not be able to afford implementing on its own servers" (Outsource IT Headaches to the Cloud (The Globe and Mail)). 
•	Prone to Attack: Storing information in the cloud could make the companies vulnerable to external hack attacks and threats; therefore there is always the lurking possibility of stealth of sensitive data.
•	Possible Downtime: Cloud computing makes the small business dependent on the reliability of their Internet connection. 
•	Cost: At first glance, a cloud computing application may appear to be a lot cheaper than a particular software solution installed and run in-house. Still, the companies need to ensure that the cloud applications have all the features that the software does and if not, to identify which are the missing features important to them. A total cost comparison is also required. While many cloud computer vendors present themselves as utility-based providers, claiming that they only charge for what customers use, Gartner says that this isn't true; in most cases, a company must commit to a predetermined contract independent of actual use. Companies need to look closely at the pricing plans and details for each application. 
•	Inflexibility: Choosing a Cloud computing vendor often means locking the business into using their proprietary applications or formats. For instance, it is not possible to insert a document created in another application into a Google Docs spreadsheet. Furthermore, a company needs to be able to add and/or subtract Cloud computing users as necessary as its business grows or contracts. 

1.7 Scheduling in Cloud Computing
 The main goal of job scheduling is to achieve a high performance computing and the best system throughput. Traditional job scheduling algorithms are not able to provide scheduling in the cloud environments. According to a simple classification [6], job scheduling algorithms in cloud computing can be categorized into two main groups; Batch mode heuristic scheduling algorithms (BMHA) and online mode heuristic algorithms. In BMHA, Jobs are queued and collected into a set when they arrive in the system. The scheduling algorithm will start after a fixed period of time. The main examples of BMHA based algorithms are; First Come First Served scheduling algorithm (FCFS), Round Robin scheduling algorithm (RR), Min–Min algorithm and Max–Min algorithm. By On-line mode heuristic scheduling algorithm, Jobs are scheduled when they arrive in the system. Since the cloud environment is a heterogeneous system and the speed of each processor varies quickly, the on-line mode heuristic scheduling algorithms are more appropriate for a cloud environment. Most fit task                         scheduling algorithm (MFTF) is suitable example of On-line mode heuristic scheduling algorithm [6].

1.7.1 Taxonomy of scheduling algorithms
The Taxonomy of scheduling algorithms in the cloud environment based on task dependency for both the independent and dependent tasks as given in Figure 1.7
•	Independent Vs Dependent Tasks
The tasks which do not require any communication between the tasks are called independent tasks. The dependent tasks differ from the independent tasks as the former have precedence order to be followed during the scheduling process. The tasks dependency plays a vital role in deciding the appropriate scheduling strategy.
•	Static Vs Dynamic Scheduling
The algorithms for task scheduling can be broadly classified as static or dynamic based on the time at which the scheduling or assignment decisions are made. In the case of static scheduling, information regarding all the resources in the cloud and the complete set of tasks as well as all the independent sub tasks involved in a job is assumed to be available by the time the task is scheduled on the cloud. But in dynamic scheduling, a prior knowledge of the resources needed by the task and the environment in which it would be executed is unavailable as the jobs arrive in a real-time mode.
