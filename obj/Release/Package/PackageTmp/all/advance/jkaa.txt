Abstract — MANETs are vulnerable to number of attacks or threats. Generally attacks are the threats against MAC, Physical, and network layer.  These layers are the most important layers that used for the routing mechanism of the ad hoc network. Black hole attack is one of the most important security problems in Mobile Ad hoc Network. It is the attack that a malicious node impersonates a destination node by sending forged RREP to a source node or initiate node that initiates route discovery, and deprives data traffic from the source node. In this paper, we present a review on number of studies that helps to detect the black hole attack in MANET.
Keywords— MANETs; Black hole attack; AODV; 

I.	INTRODUCTION

Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) [1] have become increasingly important in increasingly wide range of applications, such as battlefields and other military environments, disaster areas, and outdoor activities. A MANET is a multi-hop wireless network that is formed dynamically from an accumulation of mobile nodes without the assistance of a centralized coordinator. As the radio propagation range is limited, each mobile node has only limited information, such as its own ID and the Medium Access Control (MAC) address of its one-hop neighbours. Therefore, if two nodes are not within the radio propagation range, a multi-hop, via one or more intermediate nodes, is required to forward packets. With recent performance advancement in wireless technology, portable computing platforms and small wireless devices become indispensable devices of our daily life. The use of a portable device is constrained by its energy, making power conservation the most critical issue for portable devices and their applications. 

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is composed of a group of mobile & wireless nodes which helps in forwarding packets in a multi-hop fashion without any centralized administration. MANETs Applications occur in situations like major disaster areas, battlefields, and outdoor assemblies. A working group called “MANET” has been formed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to study the related issues and stimulate research in MANET. MANETs are self configuring wireless networks without any centralized control. As the radio range of mobile nodes is usually small, the nodes must cooperate with each other to keep the network alive. The communication between two nodes usually includes several intermediate nodes forwarding the data packets between the endpoints. Every node acts as a router. The nodes can communicate without any established infrastructure. The nodes, such as mobile phones, PDAs and laptops, in MANETs are generally lightweight and they operate on batteries. The life of a node is directly proportional to the battery in the device operating at the node. There are many efforts going on both in the industry and the academic research community to design mechanisms to save battery-life in these low powered devises. Hardware manufacturers are now making more energy-efficient devices such as energy efficient CPUs, low power display units, efficient algorithms for hardware processing and high-density batteries.
The features of MANETs and the problems/issues are summarized as follows:

Wireless medium: Mobile nodes communicate with each other through wireless medium, which means one transmission can cover all audiences within the transmission range. This broadcast nature is also referred as the Wireless Multicast Advantage (WMA). This is an advantage for broadcast or multicast traffics, however, for unicast traffic, because of the broadcast nature; the nodes within same transmission/interference range have to compete with each other for the network channel. For data access applications which follow the Client/Server model, unicast is the mostly used communication style. If there are multiple data access sessions going on simultaneously, users may encounter increased communication delay or even packet losses due to the competition and interferences from other sessions.

Multi-hop routes: In MANETs, multi-hop routes are used when a node communicates with the nodes that are out of its immediate transmission range. As analyzed by Li etc., the optimal throughput for a multi-hop communication is about 1/3 of the throughput of a single hop communication, as a forwarding node cannot transmit and receive at the same time, and the upstream and downstream nodes of the forwarding node cannot transmit at the same time because the packets would conflict at the forwarding node. Their results measured on real hardware show that the throughput drops while the number of hops covered gets increased. For data access, the indication is that as the number of hops between a client and a server increases, the throughput will decrease and the response delay will increase accordingly.

Dynamic topologies: Network topology may change for MANETs due to node mobility, exhausted power, and interferences etc. Changing of network topologies may break existing routes and cause extra overhead for establishing new routes. For data access applications, if the route to the server is broken, the client/server communication will be delayed if a new route needs to be established, or even get dropped if the new route cannot get established in time. This delay or disconnection has more chances to happen if there are more forwarding nodes involved in the client/server communication path.

Limited resources: In MANETs, the mobile nodes usually have restricted power supply, limited computing capability, and limited storage space. Due to this fact, data accesses applications shall be able to function properly with least re-source possible. That is, data access applications need to be energy-efficient and light-weight (not computing-hungry or memory-hungry).

II.	SECURITY REQUIREMENTS & ISSUES IN MANETS

2.1 Security Requirements in MANETs
Mobile wireless networks are generally more prone to physical security threats than are fixed wired networks. Existing link level security techniques (e.g. encryption) are often applied within wireless networks to reduce these type of threats. Absent link-level encryption, at the network layer, the major issue is one of inter-router authentication prior to the exchange of information regarding network control. Several levels of authentication ranging from no security and simple key approaches to fully public key infrastructure-based authentication mechanisms will be explored by the group. As the working groups efforts, a number of optional authentication modes may be standardized for use in MANETs. Some of the Security requirements in MANETs are:
•	Availability
•	Authorization and Key Management
•	Data Confidentiality
•	Data Integrity
•	Non-repudiation

2.2 Security Issues in MANET
Due to the fact that MANET is a group of nodes that form a temporary network without centralized administration, the nodes have to communicate with each other based on unconditional trust. This characteristic leads to the consequence that MANET is more susceptible to be attacked by inside the network while comparing to other type of networks. Practically, MANET could be attacked by several ways using multiple methods; before going to deeper investigation, it is necessary to classify security attacks within the context of MANET. The classification can be based on the behaviour of the attack (Passive vs. Active), the source of the attacks (Internal vs. External), the number of the attackers (Single vs. Multiple) and the processing capacity of the attackers (Wired vs. Mobile) [8]. We choose these attack classifications because they are applicable to the collaborative attacks we are categorizing. We illustrate further on the latter two as the collaborative nature of the attack could take any of the methods.

Passive vs. Active attack
Typically, passive attacks aim to steal valuable information in at least two communicating nodes or even in the whole network. There are many variations of passive attacks, but in MANET, there exist two types: eavesdropping and traffic analysis. Practically, depending on situations, passive attacks can be considered as legitimate or illegitimate actions. If the purpose is benign, for example, if the administrator wants to use some tools to probe the network traffic, in order to troubleshoot or account the network then it is legitimate. On the contrary, if the purpose is malicious, one attacker can steal valuable information by probing the network traffic such as credit card information, credential email, and then use the information to illegally withdraw money from bank accounts or blackmail the victims. Roughly speaking, passive attacks do not intend to disrupt the operation of the particular network, but active attacks are able to alter the normal network operation.

Internal vs. External attack
As the name implies, external attacks are launched by attackers who physically stay on outside of the attacked network. These attacks usually aim to deny access to specific function in the network (i.e. http traffic), or to cause network congestion or even to disrupt the whole network. While external attacks would be difficult to be launched if the network was properly configured and protected, the internal attacks are much tougher to defend against. One of the reasons is because we tend to protect the network from being attacked by outsiders rather than insiders. Also because of the fact that an external attack can easily be traced compared to the internal attack.
An external attack can become an internal attack and the consequence of the attack would be more serious. Therefore, there exist two types of internal attacker nodes, one is the compromised node, which was discussed above, and the other one is the misbehaving node, which is authorized to access the system resources but fail to use them according to the way it should be used. The detection of the Attacks caused by these internal misbehaving nodes are difficult, for example, selfish attack in which the node is unwilling to consume battery power, CPU cycles or network bandwidth to forward uninterested packets, even though it expects other nodes to forward packets for it.
III.	BLACK HOLE ATTACK

There are three types of attack:-
Single Black hole attack: This type of attack having one malicious node uses routing protocol to claim itself of being shortest path to destination node but drops routing packets and doesn’t forward packets to its neighbours. 
Cooperative Black hole attack: Black hole is a malicious node that incorrectly replies the route requests that it has a fresh route to destination and then it drops all packets which received. A chance of serious damage arises if the malicious nodes work together as a group then this is called cooperative black hole attack.
In Black hole attack a malicious node may advertise a fresh path to a destination during routing process. The intention of the node may be to disturb the path finding process or interpret the packet being sent to destination. For example, in AODV, the attacker can send a fake RREP (including a fake destination sequence number that is fabricated to be equal or higher than the one contained in the RREQ) to the initialize node called source node, claiming that it has a sufficiently fresh route to the destination node. It causes the source node to select the route that passes through the attacker node. Therefore, all traffic will be routed through the attacker node, and hence, the attacker can misuse or discard the traffic. The method how malicious node fits in the data routes varies.
Multiple Black Hole Attack: 
•	The black hole attack is even worse if the multiple Black hole nodes exist in the network.
•	When multiple black hole nodes exist in the network, all the malicious nodes are responsible for triggering the Black hole attack. 
•	In this attack multiple malicious nodes advertises itself having the shortest path to the destination and falsely replies to the route requests and drop all the receiving packets. This type of attack is called Multiple Black Hole Attack.

IV.	EXISTING TECHNIQUES

H. Deng [4] proposed the method for detecting the single black hole node in MANET. In this method, the intermediate nodes send RREP message along with the next hop information. After getting this information, the source node sends further request to next hop node to verify that it has the route to the intermediate node or not. If the route exists, the intermediate node is trusted and source node will send data packets via that trusted node. If not, the reply message from intermediate node will be discarded and alarm message is broadcasted and isolate the detected node from network. By using this method, the routing overhead and end to end delay will be increased. If black hole nodes work as a group in an attempt to drop packets then this method is not efficient.

Mohammad Al-Shurman [15] proposed the two methods to avoid the black hole attacks. According to the first solution, the source node verifies the validity of the route by finding more than one route to the destination. It waits for RREP packets to arrive from more than two nodes. When the source node receives RREP packets and the routes to destination have shared hops then the source node can then recognize the safe route. This method causes routing delay. The second solution is to store the last packet sent sequence number and the last packet received sequence number in a table. When node receives reply message from another node it checks the last sent and received sequence number. If there is any mismatch, then the ALARM packet is broadcasted which indicates the existence black hole node. This mechanism is reliable and faster having no overhead.

Latha Tamilselvan [9] proposed the solution in which the source node waits for the responses including the next hop details from other neighbouring nodes for a predefined time value. After the timeout value, it first checks in the CRRT (Collect Route Reply Table), whether there is any repeated next-hop-node or not. If any repeated next-hop node is present in the return paths, it assumes the paths are correct or the chance of malicious paths is very less. The solution adds a delay and the process of finding repeated next hop is an additional overhead.

Maha Abdelhaq, Sami Serhan, Raed Alsaqour and Rosilah Hassan [12] provide an improvement over the solution in which the used method is Source Intrusion Detection (SID) method. This mechanism is good for small scale MANET but when this mechanism is applied in a large scale MANET and the distance between the source node and the intermediate node is long then the above solution is not sufficient. Secondly, if the distance between the source node and the intermediate node is long then the delay in the discovery period of the route will be high, which causes an overall network performance degradation. In order to mitigate the drawbacks in SID security routing mechanism, a new mechanism called Local Intrusion Detection (LID) security routing mechanism is proposed to allow the detection of the attacker to be locally; which means that when the suspected intermediate node unicast the RREP towards the source node, the previous node to the intermediate node performs the process of detection and not the source node.

Yiebeltal Fantahun Alem, Zhao Chenh Xuan [13] proposed an Intrusion Detection using Anomaly Detection (IDAD) technique to prevent the black hole attack. IDAD assumes every activities of a user or a system can be monitored and anomaly activities of an intruder can be identified by normal activities. So by identifying anomaly activities of an adversary there is a possiblility to detect a possible intrusion and isolate the adversary. To do so an IDAD needs to be provided with a pre-collected set of anomaly activities that is audit data. Once audit data is collected and is given to the IDAD system, the IDAD system can compare the every activity of a host with the audit data on a fly. If any activity of a host (node) resembles with the activities listed in the audit data then this IDAD system isolates the particular node by forbidding further interaction. It minimizes the extra routing packets which in turn minimizes the network overhead and facilitates faster communication.

DRI Table and Cross Checking [16] Scheme is used to identify the cooperative black hole nodes. Each node maintains the extra DRI table with two entries “From” and “Through”, where 1 represents for true and 0 for false. These entries stand for the information on routing data packet from and through the nodes. In this solution, the Intermediate node replies the next hop information and DRI entry about next hop node along with RREP packet. The source node then checks the reliability of intermediate nodes by using cross checking scheme via alternate paths by using DRI table information. It provides 50 % throughput but increases end to end delay and routing overhead.

In the paper [19] a mechanism to detect the multiple black hole nodes has been proposed by modifying AODV protocol. This paper is an enhancement to the AODV protocol by proving more security after detecting the single or multiple black hole nodes in MANET. By using fake RREQ packet and modified RREP packet, the multiple black hole nodes are detected at the initial stage before the actual route discovery process of AODV, which leads to less routing overhead and high PDR.

V.	CONCLUSION  
Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) is a self-configuring & infrastructure less network consists of independent mobile nodes that can communicate via wireless medium. In this, each mobile node can move freely in any direction, and changes their links to other devices frequently. Security is an essential part of ad hoc networks. Due to its dynamic topology, resource constraints, no centralized infrastructure and limited security, it is vulnerable to various attacks and black hole attack is one of them. In this attack, the malicious node advertises itself as having the shortest path to the destination and falsely replies to the route requests, and drops all receiving packets. In this paper various mechanisms has been studied to detect the black hole attacks and concluded that the detection of Black Holes in ad hoc networks is still considered to be a challenging task. So, Future work is intended to an efficient cooperative black hole attack detection and elimination algorithm with minimum delay & overhead.
