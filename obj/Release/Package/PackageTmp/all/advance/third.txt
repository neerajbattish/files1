1.1 Introduction to Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  Cloud Computing includes computational and storage services as per pay as you go model. Cloud services allow individuals and businesses to use software and hardware that are managed by third parties at remote locations. Examples of cloud services include online file storage, social networking sites, webmail, and online business applications. Cloud Computing is very fascinating to business holders as it eradicates the overhead of provisioning and permits the companies to start from small and expand their resources only when there is a great rise in demand of services [1][2]. It serves two types of users: Cloud computing customers and Cloud service providers. 
Cloud computing is not something that suddenly appeared overnight; in some form it may trace back to a time when computer systems remotely time-shared computing resources and applications. More currently though, cloud computing refers to the many different types of services and applications being delivered in the internet cloud, and the fact that, in many cases, the devices used to access these services and applications do not require any special applications. Figure 1.1 represents overview of Cloud Computing.
Many companies are delivering services from the cloud. Some notable examples as of 2010 include the following:
• Google — Has a private cloud that it uses for delivering many different services to its users, including email access, document applications, text translations, maps, web analytics, and much more.
• Microsoft — Has Microsoft SharePoint online service that allows for content and business intelligence tools to be moved into the cloud and Microsoft currently makes its office applications available in a cloud.
• Salesforce.com — runs its application set for its customers in a cloud, and it’s Force.com and Vmforce.com products provide developers with platforms to build customized cloud services.
1.2 Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing have certain essential characteristics which provide qualitative services. These services (Figure 1.2) are as follows [1]:
