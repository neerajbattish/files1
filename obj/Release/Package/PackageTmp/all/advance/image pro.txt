Human Visual System is sensitive to rapidly varying areas (like edges) with high frequency components. This characteristic gives an indication that for secure steganography.
we should hide the data in image according to some model which gives us idea about the points that which areas are less sensitive and which areas are more sensitive to HVS. In other words certain model should be used which represents the characteristics of human visual system or represents the attention model of human eye. Using this attention model secret data may be embedded in the regions of an image which are seeking less attention of human eye and regions which seek high attention of human eye should be avoided for embedding. The requirement of model representing the characteristics of human visual system reminds one about the very well-known concept of Visual saliency. So, with this study perform some sort of saliency model throughout wavelet area has been offered by digesting the two approximation and also fine detail coefficients.. Further the proposed model is a device independent model as it is using the CIE L*a*b* color lab model. Proposed saliency map has been evaluated on various parameters like precision recall, F-measure etc. Then this model has been used for secure steganography. A strategy, based upon the saliency map, to distribute the secret data bits into the pixels of the image has been proposed. Also a correction method to improve the stego image has been used. Finally the decryption algorithm for retrieving the secret data has been proposed. Proposed steganography algorithm has been evaluated on parameters like MSE, PSNR capacity, quality etc.

1.6 Four Layer Security of Proposed Technique
First Layer (Inner-most): First of all ASCII code of each character of message is taken and some encryption has been performed on each ASCII code and then it has been converted to binary code. This encryption acts as the first security layer of our technique.
Second Layer: In the second layer while choosing the reflecting channel pseudo random number generator has been used that has chosen the reflecting channel randomly for each pixel so the reflecting channel is not fixed. This adds the second layer of security to the proposed technique.
Third Layer: Thirdly, the number of bits that can be hidden into each data channel of the pixel is not fixed rather it toggles between 0 to 3 bits depending upon the saliency value of the pixel. This method of choosing the number of bits to be replaced adds the third security to our technique. 
Fourth Layer (Outer-most): Finally, a saliency map has been proposed which gives the information about the salient region in an image. It dictates how much particular region/pixel is important in context of human visual attention. Based on this saliency map number of secret bits to be embedded in each pixel will be decided. This can be a most effective level associated with safety in the offered process because this kind of level allows the particular protocol to be able to combat with perceptibility associated with people which stego graphic is usually having key information. In the event that this kind of level is usually sturdy sufficient after that various other layers associated with safety may possibly make a smaller amount substantial..Non-Fix no of bits to be replaced in data channel. Saliency map based dictates number of bits to be embedded in pixel.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW

The most used image types on the net usually are images interchange structure (GIF), Shared Photographic Authorities Group(JPEG) and a smaller extent—the portable multilevel images (PNG). Almost all of the steganography tactics developed have been set-up to help take advantage of the particular set ups these types together with many exceptions inside literature in which make use of the bitmap structure (BMP) for its straightforward data framework.
2.1 Steganography Using the Image Format
Steganography can be accomplished by simply feeding into a Windows OS command window, (e.g., Windows XP) the following code: 
C :> Copy Cover.jpg / b + Message.txt/b Stego.jpg
This specific value is usually appending the key information within the writing file‘‘Message. txt’’ into the JPEG image data file ‘‘Cover. jpg’’ and makes this stego-image ‘‘Stego. jpg’’. The concept driving this really is to manipulate this acknowledgement involving EOF (End involving file). The information is usually loaded and inserted following EOF tag. As soon as Stego.jpg is usually considered applying any photo editing request, this second option will present this photo and dismiss something that comes after EOF tag. Even so, once the information is usually exposed within Notepad, this information reveals itself right after displaying many info seeing that revealed within Fig. 2. 1. The inlayed information does not impair this image top quality. None image histograms none graphic belief can certainly find any big difference between the a couple graphics a result of the technique information becoming hidden following EOF tag. Due to its ease, this process is used simply by a selection of steganography application sent out on-line including Camouflage clothing, JpegX, and Data Deposit [19]. Sad to say, this straightforward strategy wouldn't avoid almost any editing to the stego-image none any attacks simply by steganalysis authorities. Another implementation involving steganography is to append hidden info into the image’s extended data file info (EXIF), a standard as used by digicam manufacturers to retail store info inside image data file. This data can be, this help make and style of a new camera, time this photo has been considered and digitized, there option in the image, exposure time, and the focal length. It is metadata information regarding this image and its particular resource can be found in the header in the data file. Unique real estate agent Paul Alvarez [7] reviewed the opportunity involving applying such headers within a digital data evaluation to overcome baby pornography. Fig. 2. 2represents many textual content inserted into the review area of the GIF image header. This kind of just isn't the best one particular the way it has identical disadvantages seeing that of which in the EOF process. Be aware it's not necessarily advised to hide info immediately without encrypting as in this case in point.

2.2 Steganography in Spatial Domain
The latest steganalytic techniques show of which the most frequent paradigm in photograph steganography such as the bit-replacement or even little bit replacement can be inherently vulnerable along with “safe capacities” [49]. Several types of steganography usually are based upon the particular adjustment in the very least significant bits of pixel valuations or even the particular rearrangement connected with shades to produce very least significant little bit or even parity little bit patterns, which usually match the particular meaning becoming undetectable. One of several commonly used techniques could be the LSB the place that the very least significant bits of each and every pixel usually are substituted simply by bits of the secrets meaning right up until key meaning completes [39]. Using this method is very simple however the risk connected with info becoming discovered can be large because it can be susceptible to most ‘sequential scanning’ dependent techniques [49], that is intimidating it's safety. The haphazard pixel adjustment method [39] makes an attempt to conquer the particular sequential deciphering trouble. In this particular method the particular pixels (which will be accustomed to cover data) usually are preferred within a haphazard style according to some sort of stego-key. Yet here a few synchronization between the agencies is essential that ought to possibly be contributed between the agencies connected with connection [39]. It'll fit the real key managing over head for the system. A different method could be the Stego Shade Cycle (SCC) which usually makes use of the particular RGB photos to cover the results in a variety of channels. It keeps bicycling the particular undetectable information between the Red-colored, environmentally friendly in addition to Orange channels, using a single station with a cycle occasion [39]. The key trouble in this method can be of which, the results can be undetectable inside the channels within a methodical means, rendering it able to get the information inside the primary few pixels of which therefore will always make the particular finding in the method easy. Stego PRNG is usually another method of which makes use of the particular RGB photos. In this method, some sort of pseudo haphazard range power generator (PRNG) is used to decide on a few pixels in the handle photograph. After that, the secrets meaning can be undetectable inside the Orange station in the determined pixels [39]. Again this method features trouble connected with controlling the real key in conjunction with trouble connected with capability because it makes use of just the particular Orange station out from the several channels with their obtainable channels As outlined by block origin legislation connected with steganography, below a few assumptions, the entire capability can be asymptotically proportional to block root of number of insures. But the entire legislation might be a suite connected with theorems proving which it keeps below a number of ailments. 2 critical constraints in the legislation usually are:

•	It won't implement as soon as excellent steganography is available.
•	It properly applies to the volume of embedding adjustments, definitely not  payload.
It turns out of which payload capability can be connected with get v(NlogN) given greatest adaptive source coding [87]. The Fibonacci LSB Files Camouflaging Method decomposes pixels into a different number of bit-planes, while using Fibonacci–p-sequences in addition to inlayed some sort of key message-bit into a pixel in the event that the idea passes the particular Zeckendorf issue, then during removal the idea employs the particular invert course of action [10]. A different information concealing method applying prime decomposition is surely an advancement more than Fibonacci. Exclusive bit-planes usually are produced applying Prime Decomposition plus it upload some sort of key message-bit into a pixel as long as soon after embedding the idea nevertheless remains like a valid rendering. It is proven that it method increases the selections for embedding simply by growing number of bit-planes in addition to gives less distortion as compared with conventional binary in addition to Fibonacci Decomposition though embedding meaning in increased bit-planes [143]. A different information concealing method will there be that is based upon decomposition of any range (pixel-value) in amount of normal numbers. This particular rendering all over again creates another number of (virtual) bit-planes entirely, ideal for embedding functions. A lot more little bit planes could be obtained employing this method than Prime method [40]. These little bit planes not merely let you to definitely upload key meaning in increased little bit planes and also undertake it with out significantly distortion, and supplies an obviously better stego-image good quality within a trustworthy in addition to guaranteed approach. Graphic good quality in the stego-image undetectable with the normal decomposition method enhances significantly towards of which applying Prime in addition to Fibonacci decomposition method. Several steganography techniques usually are assessed for the guidelines connected with visible inspection connected with photos, design research connected with chunks, visible inspection connected with pixels in addition to design research connected with colour scheme. So though planning some sort of steganography procedure it should be taken proper care which it shouldn't be very easily detectable simply by examining any type of design inside the photograph [39]. A different steganalytic means for detection connected with LSB Steganography in Shade in addition to Grayscale Graphics is predicated on examining the particular variances in the volume of typical in addition to novel teams with the LSB and the “shifted LSB plane”. Unfortunately here it's possible to identify the particular mail messages seeing that quick seeing that 0. 03bpp [50]. A different LSB Centered Steganographic Way of 8-bit Shade Graphics combined the particular photograph compression in addition to steganography. This method commences that has a 24-bit color bitmap report, after which it compresses the particular report simply by organizing in addition to optimizing the 8-bit color chart. After the technique of compression, some sort of text can be undetectable inside the last (compressed) photograph. Yet this method can be getting negative aspect of which the dimensions of handle photograph can be decreased that is very theraputic for efficient bandwidth usage but it limitations the dimensions of key text message and so lessens the capacity [80]. A different steganography method makes use of the least Substantial Portions (LSB) attachment to cover information within encrypted photograph information. The binary rendering in the undetectable information is used to overwrite the particular LSB of each byte inside the encrypted photograph arbitrarily. Fresh results indicate that the effects in addition to entropy valuations in the encrypted photograph prior to a attachment act like the particular valuations connected with effects in addition to entropy following attachment.
